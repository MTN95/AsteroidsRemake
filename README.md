<div align="center"> 
This project was inspired by the One Lone Coder [Asteroids Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgDR8LrRZhk)

Recreated with SDL2 instead of the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
Developed over a few days as an engaging side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies.

I chose to use the GLM library for 2D vector manipulation for its ease of use, although it might seem a bit of an overkill for a simple game. 

The Game Objective, and Gameplay Mechanics

    A simple remake, destroy all the asteroids to win, if you get hit by an asteroid you lose. 
    accelerate with the 'UP' key and rotate with 'LEFT' 'RIGHT, Press 'SPACE' to shoot bullets.

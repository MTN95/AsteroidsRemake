### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
Developed over a few days as an engaging side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies.
I chose to use the GLM library for 2D vector manipulation for its ease of use, although it might seem a bit much for a simple game. 
The collision detection is straightforward, but it effectively fulfills its intended function.
